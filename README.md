## Sailfish Remote Controller

[简体中文](README_CN.md)

#### This is the server side of Sailfish Remote Controller, this project is NOT well tested, so, if you want to use or publish in product environment, you should debug it yourself !  
#### The project is NOT a universal remote controller app, please read the doc following. 

#### Why?
I want to control other computers in my local area network, some of the other computers have 2 monitors. I've known that VNC is a good choice, but I need to connect many computers at same time with high FPS.  
Some business products work very well, although multiple monitors function is chargeable, therefore I start to develop this project.

#### Basic framework

#### Here is a list of the used technologies that you may want to lean 
- Cpp for both server and client
- Qt for the UI
- FFmpeg for encoding and decoding
- OpenGL for client displaying
- Opus for audio encoding and decoding
- VCPKG for package manager
- DDA(Desktop Duplication API) for capturing image
- Libyuv for converting image's format
- Websocket for sending & receiving data packages
- ProtoBuf for serializing data
- LevelDB for saving simple config

#### Here is the tutorial
- [0. Prepare environment & How to build ]()
- [1. How to capture an image of your screen with DDA(Desktop Duplication Api)]()
- [2. How to copy the image from GPU to CPU and convert to I420]()
- [3. How to encode an image by FFmpeg]()
- [4. How to pack the encoded frame to protobuf and send via network]()
- [5. How to capture a cursor and send via network]()
- [6. How to capture audio and encode by OPUS]()
- [7. How to Replay cursor and keyboard events]()
- [8. How to decode a encoded frame]()
- [9. How to render frame by OpenGL]()

#### Features  
- Support H264 and H265, both hardware and software with ffmpeg
- Support multiple clients at same time
- Support 1 monitor or 2 monitors
- Support high FPS
- Support clipboard for TEXT
- Support audio

#### Roadmap
- Relay mode
- File transfer
- Different monitors size
- Encode with NVENC directly
- Web client

### Here are Server's UI and instruction
#### Server main ui
- IP Accessible: Your computer's IP, one or more
- Port Listening: The port that server is listening on

#### Server settings ui
- Encoder: H264 or H265, choose Hxxx_nvenc first
- Capture Mode: Capture single monitor or all monitors at same time, I'm normally using 2 monitors.
- Running Mode: "Auto fps" means to capture an image when the content has changed while "Try fixing fps" will use a cached image.
- Multi clients: Enable multiple clients to connect at same time or not.
- Preserve time: After the duration in seconds, the image capture, audio capture ,etc, will be destroyed.
